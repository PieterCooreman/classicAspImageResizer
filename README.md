Image Resizing, Recoloring and Cropping

Classic ASP Developers never had an easy way to resize, recolor and crop images, unless they used expensive 3rd party Image components.

Therefore I decided to come up with something useful. The script offered for download below this page takes care of the following:

automatically resize images
recolor images
crop images
I am using this resizing-trick for some years in QuickerSite (www.quickersite.com), a Classic ASP CMS that I develop, sell and support.

Enjoy !
